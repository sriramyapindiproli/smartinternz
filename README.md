# Co2 Emission Analysis
## Introduction
Global warming is one of the biggest challenges currently being faced by the human race, although
correlation is not causation, a likely cause of global warming is due to increased atmospheric carbon
dioxide from human activities. CO2 Emission refers to the Carbon Dioxide emitted throughout the
world. For this analysis we will be focusing on CO2 Emissions and its effect on the world we live in as
well as some key factors and stats that may play a role in the emission of CO2 globally. Fossil fuel
use is the primary source of CO2. The data throws light onto how much fossil fuels are burnt, per year
per nation, which amounts to an increase in CO2 every year. This will help researchers and
environment experts to predict global warming. So countries should set a goal to decrease this
amount yearly.
- Analysing Global Co2 Emission across countries from 1975 to 2020. This dataset contains a
record of Co2 Emission by each Country and Region of Earth, here we are going to analyse and
visualise Country wise, Region wise and Overall Co2 Emission on Earth.


## Steps
As a data analyst working for a policy research institute, you are tasked with creating a visualization that helps policymakers and researchers understand the trends in CO2 emissions and their relationship with various socio-economic factors. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the project:

1. **Business Requirements:** The business requirements for analysing the Co2 Emission Globally over time,identifying affecting factors, creating interactive dashboards and reports, identifying areas for improvement, making data-driven decisions, comparing to countries average and creating forecasting models for future performance. The ultimate goal is to gain insights and reduce the emission through data visualization techniques.
2.**Business Impact:**Social Impact: Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate
change. Itâ€™s widely recognised that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the
world needs to urgently reduce emissions.
Business Model/Impact: By conducting an analysis the countries can identify areas
for improvement and take steps to reduce factors that are responsible for Co2
Emission for environmental sustainability by improving the efficiency and transitioning
to low carbon alternatives.
3. **Download Datasets:** We need to download the necessary datasets:
   - [CO2 Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n764uDPT_ZF7kzGFLtpxkwBBsDBScbWm/view)
  
4. **Storing Data in DB & Perform SQL Operations** Here we'e used MySQL Workbench.
5. **Connect DB with Tableau** 
6. **Prepare the Data for Visualization:**
Preparing the data for visualization involves cleaning the data to remove irrelevant or missing
data, transforming the data into a format that can be easily visualized, exploring the data to
identify patterns and trends, filtering the data to focus on specific subsets of data, preparing
the data for visualization software, and ensuring the data is accurate and complete. Since the
Data is initially pre-processed we can skip this step. Basically this process helps to make the
data easily understandable and ready for creating visualizations to gain insights into the
performance and efficiency.

  
7. **Creating the Visualization:** With the linked and cleaned data, we proceed to create a compelling visualization.

   - We use Tableau's features to build an interactive chart that displays CO2 emissions per capita over time.

   - Users can explore the data by selecting specific years, countries, and variables.
    **No of Visualizations/ Graphs**
- 1. Top World Emission
- 2. Top Emitting Countries
- 3. Co2 Emission over Time
- 4. Co2 Emission India vs USA
- 5. Total Emission by Continents
- 6. Co2 Emission per Capita
- 7. Co2 Emission by International Factors
- 8. Emission Rate over Years
- 9. Donut Chart-Coal Co2
- 10. Continent Contribution in Co2 Emission

8. **Create Dashboards and Stories**
